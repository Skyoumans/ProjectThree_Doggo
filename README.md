# ProjectThree_Doggo

## About


This is Doggo, an social application where a dog owner can post their 

dog and, if necessary, put their dog up for adoption. An owner can also 

see a list of dogs available to adopt and save them to their profile for 

easy viewing.


The app itself is a full-stack MERN application, using React, Express, 

Node, and Mongoose.


## Motivation


I created this app as a tribute to my own pet, who I had to re-home

recently due to relocation issues and a lack of time available to 

dedicate to her. This application (when fully fleshed out) would allow 

an owner ease of mind when having to make that hard decision by letting 

owners communicate with each other and put themselves at ease about 

having to let go of a loved pet.

## Trials and Tribulations


This project was particularly challenging. React is a complex JS 

language, and while easy to comprehend, I would find myself having to 

step back and see the whole picture, with all the components and the 

linking between everything. That being said, I completed the MVP for the 

project, and want to revisit the code so I may create the vision I have 

for this application in my head. 

## Next in Line
 
 - Adding a landing page, where owners can easily log in, sign up, and  view an index of dogs
 - Adding a view for each dog on the Landing Page, listing the information about the dog, as well as breed information about the animal.
 - Adding a carousel to a home page, where owners can see a rotating list of each dog picture, that allows for a link to view that dog.

I had a great deal of help from Jayme, Brandon, Erica, Victoria, and Aaron. Burns and Jaime were also great helps in guiding me during the times I was lost.
